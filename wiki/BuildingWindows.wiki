 # You'll want a compiler something like  [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/ Visual C# Express 2008] which is free , Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2005.
 # If not installed. Install the compiler of your choice. Beware, The project files that will be automatically created are only tested with Visual Studio.
 # You'll want to get a [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74626&package_id=223067 GTK# runtime] as well. 2.10.3 works.
 # If not installed, install the GTK# runtime now.
 # You'll also want to get the most recent source from the svn at http://openviewer.org/svn/openviewer/trunk. If you don't have it already a good client for [http://subversion.tigris.org/ subversion] is [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortoiseSVN].
 # After that is downloaded, if you are using Visual C# Express Edition 2008 or Visual Studio 2008, run the runprebuild2008.bat file. If you are using Visual Studio 2005 use runprebuild.bat.
 # In the bin directory open the OpenViewer.ini.example file. Comment out the {{{rendering_engine = ogredotnet}}} line with a semicolon (;) and uncomment the {{{rendering_engine = mogre}}} line by removing the semicolon.
 # Load the Openviewer.sln and build the project.
