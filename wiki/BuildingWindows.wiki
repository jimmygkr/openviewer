A short explanation on how to get OpenViewer compiled and running on a windows machine.


= Details =

You'll want a compiler something like  [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/ Visual C# Express]which is free , Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2005.

if not installed. Install the compiler of your choice. Beware, The project files created are only tested with visual studio.

You'll want to get a gtk# runtime as well. 2.10.3 works
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74626&package_id=223067

If not installed, install this.

You'll also want to get the most recent source from the svn. http://openviewer.org/svn/openviewer/trunk
If you don't have it already a good client for svn is TortoiseSVN http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

When that is downloaded if you are using Visual C# Express Edition 2008 or Visual Studio 2008, run the runprebuild2008.bat file. If you are using Visual Studio 2005 use runprebuild.bat.

in the bin directory open the OpenViewer.ini.example file. Comment out the 
rendering_engine = ogredotnet line and uncomment the rendering_engine = mogre line.
